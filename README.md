## Applying multilayer analysis to morphological, structural and functional brain networks to identify relevant dysfunction patterns

In this study, we aimed to combine the morphological, structural and functional information defining a new multilayer network perspective, which has been shown advantageous to jointly analyse multiple types of relational information regarding the same objects at once by using graph-mining techniques. The main contribution of this work is the design, development and validation of a multilayer scheme that combines these three layers of information into a unique multilayer network, where the integrity of white matter connections links and relates grey matter probability maps and resting-state fMRI. To validate our framework, we also extend several metrics from graph theory to adapt them to our specific domain characteristics. This proof of concept has been applied to a cohort of people with MS, it has shown that we are able to  identify several brain regions with a synchronised connectivity deterioration.
